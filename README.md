# Trained-SHVN-using-CNN

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset. The dataset consists of digit images obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the complete workflow of loading, preprocessing, and training a CNN model on the SVHN dataset. The workflow includes data augmentation, model training, validation, and saving the best model. Additionally, the README outlines steps for testing the trained model on unseen data.

Features:
Dataset: SVHN (Street View House Numbers)
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Data Augmentation: Applied to improve generalization
Evaluation: Training and validation accuracy and loss tracking
Callback: Early stopping and model checkpointing
Testing: Evaluate model on test images
Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
h5py (for saving the model in .h5 format)
